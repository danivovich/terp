;; Examples of writing tests.
;; Test files must end in `_test.tp`

(require "prelude/test.tp")
(require "prelude/list.tp")

;; Some basic example assertions/refutations:
(assert (equal? #t #t))
(assert (equal? 5 5))
(refute (equal? #f #t))

;; Testing something that actually does something:
(defn plus2 (x)
  (+ 2 x))

(let ls '(1 2 3 4 5))

(assert (equal?
         (map plus2 ls)
         '(3 4 5 6 7)))
