** DONE recursive functions

   =letrec= to define a recursive function
   This was a huge headache to actually get working, but so exciting when it did finally work.

   My naive attempt was to set up a dummy environment record for the function name so that the name wouldn't be unbound in the function body.
   This didn't end up working very well.

   Opted instead to pull out the free variable (e.g. function's name) from the function body, wrap the definition in an anonymous function, and use the Y-combinator to get the function's fixpoint.
   Then set the fixpoint function to the name in the environment.
** TODO pattern matching
   =pmatch= or equivalent, a list of possible cases and evaluate the first that's true
** TODO add strings
